    <p>Based on the research conducted by Fielding E. Montgomery in Statistics of Swing and preliminary data exploration, we conducted an analysis on a number of factors to determine characteristics of swing states in the United States. Through the use of regression models we have determined statistically significantly features for swing states based on the United States Presidential elections. Focusing on understanding the impacts of demographics across the United States, we determined swing state features include a large middle class, large proportion of young citizens, and large percentage of religious members.

    <p>Our data of non White citizens, middle class, and number of young citizens was taken from the American Factfinder. The raw data is from the United States census, which is conducted every ten years combined with surveys resulting in annual estimates for demographic data in the United States by state and congressional district.</p>

    <p>We define non white citizens as the percentage of white citizens in each state. After further exploration of the data, we realized that the estimates do not include the hispanic population. The hispanic population is included in the white population. We chose to continue on with the hypothesis, but to be wary of our results as an important aspect of racial demographics was absent and may have altered our results. </p>

    <p>We define middle class as annual household incomes from $25,000-$150,000. The middle class is defined as such because the poverty line is below $25,000 and the top 5% of the population begins at $150,000. Defining the middle class is difficult and while this measure may be contested, we choose to maintain this measure because people across the country define middle class in many ways. We choose to maintain this measure to compare across all states, but to keep this in mind when coming to final conclusions.</p>

    <p>The percentage of young citizens is a combined percentage of people ages 15-34, taken from census data on the American Factfinder website.

The relative proportion of religious members in each state is taken from the Research and Landscape Study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2014 with 35,071 responses, and a minimum of 300 responses from each state. The results of the study hold a margin of error less than one percent, making this survey a reliable source in determining religious adherents in each state. The study defines religion on a scale based on a combined index of importance of religion, frequency of prayer, worship attendance, and belief in god. The percent of religious adherents for each state was taken from this survey and compared against the election results from the 2016 presidential election.

The number of total campaign visits in the 2016 election is taken from data collected by FairVote and is a compilation of campaign events in each state during the 2016 general election. This measures campaign efforts in each state.

Power to vote is taken from the distribution of electoral college votes from 1964-2012 by state compared against the total state population from the United States census years.</p>
