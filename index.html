    <p>Based on the research conducted by Fielding E. Montgomery in Statistics of Swing and preliminary data exploration, we conducted an analysis on a number of factors to determine characteristics of swing states in the United States. Through the use of regression models we have determined statistically significantly features for swing states based on the United States Presidential elections. Focusing on understanding the impacts of demographics across the United States, we determined swing state features include a large middle class, large proportion of young citizens, and large percentage of religious members.

  <section>
    <p>Our data on non White citizens, middle class, and number of young citizens was taken from the American Factfinder website, which has raw data from the United States census. The census is conducted every ten years combined with surveys from the ACS (American Community Survey) which are taken in each intermediate year, resulting in annual estimates for demographic data in the United States by state and congressional district.10 </p>
<p>We define non white citizens as the combined percentage of African American, American Indian, Asian, Pacific Islander, and “other” citizens in each state defined by the United States Census. After further exploration of the data, we found that the estimates do not include the Hispanic population, which was included in the white population. We chose to continue on with the hypothesis, but to be wary of our results as an important aspect of racial demographics was absent and may have altered our results.   </p>
<p>We define middle class as annual household incomes from $25,000-$150,000. The middle class is defined as such because the poverty line is below $25,000 and the top 5% of the population begins at $150,000.3 Defining the middle class is difficult and while this measure may be contested, we choose to maintain this measure because people across the country define middle class in many ways. Testing the impacts of median household incomes in each state for the years 2012 and 2016, we find that there is not a significant effect (p = .7838). 9 We choose to use the measure of middle class because cost of living and median income in each state do not significantly impact swing, but to keep this in mind when coming to final conclusions.</p>
<p>The percentage of young citizens is a combined percentage of people ages 15-34, taken from census data on the American Factfinder website.
The relative proportion of religious members in each state is taken from the Research and Landscape Study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2014 with 35,071 responses, and a minimum of 300 responses from each state. The results of the study hold a margin of error less than one percent, making this survey a reliable source in determining religious adherents in each state. The study defines religion on a scale based on a combined index of importance of religion, frequency of prayer, worship attendance, and belief in god. The percent of religious adherents for each state was taken from this survey and compared against the election results from the 2016 presidential election.   </p>
<p>The number of total campaign visits in the 2016 election is taken from data collected by FairVote and is a compilation of campaign events in each state during the 2016 general election. This measures campaign efforts in each state.
Power to vote is taken from the distribution of electoral college votes from 1964-2012 by state compared against the total state population from the United States census years.  </p>

    <h1 class="pageTitle">HYPOTHESIS AND LINES OF EXPLORATION</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>Our decision to focus on demographic information when understanding the characteristics of swing states was due to the key differences that exist across the counties in different geographic locations. Based on the findings of Fielding E. Montgomery in his thesis Statistics of Swing and our initial analysis of demographic data, we tested a number of hypotheses that may have significant effect on presidential election results. We attempt to understand the characteristics of what makes states swing from one party to another in presidential elections.</p>
	<p>We tested six factors that we believe will have statistically significant effects in why states swing. We determine two different ways to measure  “swing” to test our data. One way is to count the number of times a state switched parties in presidential elections. We chose to start counting starting in 1964 because up until the1960s the Democrat and Republican parties had a major shift and aligned themselves across different policy beliefs. Historically, Democrats were supporters of small government, while Republicans believed in maintaining a large government. Over the years, crucial policy changes altered traditional party beliefs and the Democrats and Republican parties core values switched. Counting switches from 1964 and on also aligned with the census data we obtained on some of our demographic data, maintaining consistency. This measure of swing helps compare states to one another because while some states have never changed parties, other states change their votes at a high frequency and are classified as having higher levels of swing. One drawback of this measurement method is that it does not reflect how close the vote is in a state.</p>
<p>The second method of measuring if a state is a swing state is by the difference in percentage of Democrat and Republican votes in each presidential election by state, taken from the Federal Election Commission. Compared to the other measurement method, this method gives more information about how close elections are. This allowed us to differentiate between states that swing frequently and by how close the elections are. An increase in swing for this measure is expressed by a smaller margin between democrat and republican votes. A drawback of this method is that sometimes elections are close in states that never actually swing, leading to a false perception of swing.</p>
<p>Our first hypothesis we test is as the percentage of a state’s middle class increases, so does their swing. The middle class is a unique group that can be both liberal and conservative in its economic policy preferences. It can both benefit and be disadvantaged by economic policies chosen by the president. As the middle class in a state grows, it gives both Democrats and Republicans the ability to influence middle class voters, making it a measure of interest when determining swing.</p>
<p>The second hypothesis of interest is as the percent of non white citizens increases, so does a states swing. The growing minority populations in the United States are increasing diversity. As racial demographics become more diverse in a state, politicians have a better chance at persuading voters, increasing the chance for that state to swing.</p>
	<p>Another hypothesis we test for is as the percentage of young citizens increase, swing increases as well. Older voters tend to vote Republican while younger voters tend to vote Democrat. As the percentage of young voters increases, the political preferences of that state’s voters becomes more diverse and elections become closer, increasing the chance for a state to swing.</p>
	<p>A fourth hypothesis we believe to hold true is as religious adherents decrease in a state, the swing in a state increases. Religious members tend to vote conservatively, so the less people who hold their values with religion will have more of the ability to swing their votes. As Americans become less religious, those who are tie their vote to religious values since they are decreasing, allowing a state's ability to swing to grow. </p>
<p>As the incentive to vote, or power to vote, measured by electoral votes per capita, increases, we believe that swing increases as well. The electoral college systematically disadvantages states with larger populations due to the nature of vote distributions. A vote in Wyoming has 3.6 times the power than one in California. States that are more densely populated have less power in their vote, making the incentive to vote decrease. </p>
<p>Our final hypothesis of interest is that as increased campaign efforts in states increase, the swing in a state increases. The difficulty in this measure is understanding what factor is causing what. Are presidential candidates spending more time in a state because the state is a swing state, or is the state a swing state because the candidates spend more time there? And if a candidate's increase in campaign efforts in a state that was once considered a swing state, but no longer carries that qualities to make it a swing state, that state may remain classified as a swing state because candidate increase efforts because of historical knowledge and not because characteristics that make it a swing state are no longer relevant. This hypothesis will be tested with the understanding that the results cannot be classified as a characteristic of swing, but rather to help us understand why swing states matter in presidential campaigns.</p>

  </header>
  <section>
    <p>Using simple linear regression models in R, measuring each characteristic independently against the measure of swing we were able to find which characteristics have statistically significant effects on swing. To reject the null hypothesis, the p value must fall below .05, and many of our results fail to do so. The hypothesis with statistically significant results are middle class, young citizens, religious adherents, power to vote, and campaign visits.</p>
    <img src = "images/table.PNG">
    <p> Our first hypothesis of the percentage of the middle class allows us to reject the null hypothesis with 95% confidence when measured against closeness of the vote. The negative coefficient follows are hypothesis that as the middle class increases, the margin between votes for democrats and republicans decreases showing an increase in swing.</p>
<p>Analysis of the percentage of young citizens allows us to reject our null hypothesis with 99% confidence that as the number of young citizens increase, the margin increases, meaning swing decreases. While our original hypothesis expected the reverse effect, there is a clear significant effect on age and swing. </p>
<p>Regression analysis of the hypothesis that observes the proportion of religious adherents decreases, swing increases show that we can be 95% confident in rejecting the null and conclude that there is a significant negative effect on religion and swing based on the number of swings by state.</p>
<p>Analysis of power of the vote by state shows significant effect as power increases, swing decreases. We can say with 95% confidence that as power increases, swing decreases when measure by margin of votes. This effect is the opposite of what was expected. Initial analysis from data in the 2016 election saw this effect as not significant, but further explorations and increase in measure to include all years starting from 1964 allowed us to be confident there exists a significant effect.  </p>
<p>The final significant effect we found was our hypothesis of campaign visits. This measure allowed us to reject the null with 99% confidence that there is no relationship between campaign efforts and swing through both measures of swing. The coefficients show a positive correlation between swing and campaign visits. While this effect appears to be highly significant, we do not consider this a factor that contributes to swing, but rather what occurs because of campaigns knowledge of swing. </p>
<p>The only hypothesis that we believed would have significant effect and we were unable to find significant evidence to reject our null was percentage of non white citizens. Based on the data we collected, we cannot conclude that there is evidence to support that the percentage of non white citizens has a significant effect on a state’s swing. </p>

    <h1 class="pageTitle">CONCLUSIONS</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
<p>Based on the simple linear regression conducted we are confident that characteristics of swings states include a large middle class, small proportion of young citizens, smaller power to vote, and large percentage of religious members. Understanding which characteristics impact the swing of a state is key to understanding election results and can potentially be used to make predictions in future elections, as well as understanding why presidential candidates increase their efforts in certain states. </p>
    <p>Figure 1 illustrates the importance of swing states in presidential campaigns. The data from the 2016 election events tracker shows how candidates target their efforts in certain states, which have been classified as swing states in previous elections due to high swing counts and close votes. Of the 399 documented campaign visits, 273 of them occurred in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, and Michigan. These six states are historically swing states, and where the 2016 presidential candidates focused their campaign efforts. A majority of the country was ignored during these campaigns, with few or no visits to states who have lower swing rates. Candidates know that they are either going to win or lose in those states and would rather focus efforts in places they believe will be impacted.</p>
