    <p>Based on the research conducted by Fielding E. Montgomery in Statistics of Swing and preliminary data exploration, we conducted an analysis on a number of factors to determine characteristics of swing states in the United States. Through the use of regression models we have determined statistically significantly features for swing states based on the United States Presidential elections. Focusing on understanding the impacts of demographics across the United States, we determined swing state features include a large middle class, large proportion of young citizens, and large percentage of religious members.

    <p>Our data of non White citizens, middle class, and number of young citizens was taken from the American Factfinder. The raw data is from the United States census, which is conducted every ten years combined with surveys resulting in annual estimates for demographic data in the United States by state and congressional district.</p>

    <p>We define non white citizens as the percentage of white citizens in each state. After further exploration of the data, we realized that the estimates do not include the hispanic population. The hispanic population is included in the white population. We chose to continue on with the hypothesis, but to be wary of our results as an important aspect of racial demographics was absent and may have altered our results. </p>

    <p>We define middle class as annual household incomes from $25,000-$150,000. The middle class is defined as such because the poverty line is below $25,000 and the top 5% of the population begins at $150,000. Defining the middle class is difficult and while this measure may be contested, we choose to maintain this measure because people across the country define middle class in many ways. We choose to maintain this measure to compare across all states, but to keep this in mind when coming to final conclusions.</p>

    <p>The percentage of young citizens is a combined percentage of people ages 15-34, taken from census data on the American Factfinder website.

The relative proportion of religious members in each state is taken from the Research and Landscape Study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2014 with 35,071 responses, and a minimum of 300 responses from each state. The results of the study hold a margin of error less than one percent, making this survey a reliable source in determining religious adherents in each state. The study defines religion on a scale based on a combined index of importance of religion, frequency of prayer, worship attendance, and belief in god. The percent of religious adherents for each state was taken from this survey and compared against the election results from the 2016 presidential election.

The number of total campaign visits in the 2016 election is taken from data collected by FairVote and is a compilation of campaign events in each state during the 2016 general election. This measures campaign efforts in each state.

Power to vote is taken from the distribution of electoral college votes from 1964-2012 by state compared against the total state population from the United States census years.</p>

    <p>We decided to focus on demographic information because in understanding characteristics of swing states because of the key differences that exists across the countries in different geographic locations. Based on the findings of Fielding E. Montgomery in his thesis Statistics of Swing and our initial analysis of demographic data, we tested a number of hypothesis that may have significant effect on presidential election results. We attempt to understand the characteristics of what makes states swing from one party to another in presidential elections.</p>

	<p>We tested six factors that we believe will have statistically significant effects in why states swing. We determine two different ways to measure  “swing” to test our data. One way is to count the number of times a state switched parties in presidential elections. We chose to start counting starting in 1964 because around the 1960s the democrat and republican parties had a major shift and aligned themselves across different policy beliefs.Historically, democrats were supporters of a small government, while republicans wanted large government. Over the years, crucial policy changes altered the traditional party beliefs, leaving the democrats and republican to essentially switch sides. Counting switches from 1964 and on also aligned with the census data we obtained on some of our demographic data. This measure of swing helps compare states to one another because while some states have never changed parties, other states change their votes at a high frequency and are classified as having higher levels of swing. One drawback of this measurement method is that it does not reflect how close the vote is in a state.

<p>The second method of measuring if a state is a swing state is by the difference in percentage of Democrat and Republican votes in each presidential election by state, taken from the Federal Election Commission. Compared to the other measurement method, this method gives more information about how close elections are. This allowed us to differentiate between states that swing a lot and by how close the elections are. A drawback here is that sometimes elections are close in states that never actually swing, leading to a false perception of swing.</p>

  <p>Our first Hypothesis we test is as the percentage of a states middle class increases, so does there swing. The middle class is a unique group that can both liberal and conservative in its economic policy preferences. It can both benefit and be disadvantaged by economic policies. As the middle class in a state grows, it gives both Democrats and Republicans the ability to influence middle class voters.

	Both the non white citizens and young citizen hypothesis come from findings that the more diverse a community, the larger ability there is to influence a population. As racial demographics and age change within a states, campaigns have the ability to influence groups to change their votes, and these elections tend to be closer. Based on our findings, non white citizens do not have a significant effect, but young citizens is highly significant.

	As religious adherents decrease, the swing in a state increases. Religious members tend to vote conservatively, so the less people who hold their values with religion will have more of the ability to swing their votes. Our analysis holds this true for number of swings but not for the margin of votes.

As the incentive to vote, or power to vote measured by electoral votes per capita, increases we hypothesize that swing increases as well. Our findings do not support this.

	Our final hypothesis of interest is that increased campaign efforts in states increase the swing in a state. Based on our analysis, we can support this hypothesis. However, we choose to not include this in our conclusion. It is difficult to know exactly how accurate this measure is. Campaigns focus their efforts on states that are known to swing, so a state may remain a swing state even if the characteristic that once made it swing is not longer relevant.</p>
